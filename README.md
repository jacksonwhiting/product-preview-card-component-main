## My process

### Built with

- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The goal of this product was to build a simple product card component using HTML and CSS (no frameworks or libraries).  

I had to re-learn flexbox and used it for the layout.  It was so fun to get back into coding and build something from scratch.  Looking forward to the next project!

### Continued development

As I move into larger projects I'd like to learn how to incorporate CSS grid with Flexbox for optimal layouts.

Additionally, I'll be working on responsive images and a more responsive design.
